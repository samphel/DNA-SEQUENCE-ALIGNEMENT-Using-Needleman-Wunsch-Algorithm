# DNA-SEQUENCE-ALIGNEMENT-Using-Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm
ADA Project made by Utsav Singh and Samphel Bodh in 4th Semester.

The sequences in the sequence folder are made up sequences to show how the program would work for real DNA sequences.
New sequences can be added into the sequences folder and it will automatically show up in as an option in the program.
